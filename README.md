# Calendarium_Latinum

Calendarium Latinum Twitter bot (twitter.com/CalendariumLat) by Fergus Walsh.

A bot that tweets the day of the week, date and year everyday in Latin.

Days of the week follow the pagan names: dies Lunae, dies Martis etc. (see Isidore of Seville "Etymologiae" V.30). The date is given in the ancient Roman method, reconded from the Kalends, Nones and Ides of each month. The year is given "from the foundation of the city" fixed by convention of Varro to 753 B.C.

The calendar used is the Gregorian calendar, not the Julian or 10-month Republican calendar.
